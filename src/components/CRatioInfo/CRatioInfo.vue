        C-Ratio needs to be at least 300%.<br />
        If your C-Ratio is above 500%, youâ€™ll earn rewards in wTPC.<br />
        If your C-Ratio falls below 300%, your wTPC will be locked (not liquidated) until the C-Ratio goes back to at
        least 300%. That can happen either via TPC price fluctuations or if you add more wTPC as collateral.
